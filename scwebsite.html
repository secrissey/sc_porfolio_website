<h1> Stephanie Crissey: Who is she?? </h1>

<p> Hello and welcome to my website. I am learning how to code and hope to become a web developer. I look forward to exploring this exciting new field of software development and code. A dedicated and passionate learner who never shys away from a challenge, I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to be in this program at <a href="https://codingtemple.com/"> Coding Temple. </a> I look forward to the many doors that the skill of coding can open in the world and the opportunity to work remotely from anywhere. </p>

<!-- this is the start of my background/hobbies -->
<h2> Background </h2>

<p> My previous experience is in Events and Promotions. Although it may seem a world of difference from software development, I think I'll find I have to apply the same problem solving skills I developed working unpredictable live events as I will in softward development. In my free time I enjoy engaging in an array of diverse activities. A list of some of my hobbies includes: </p>

	<ul>
	  <li> traveling </li>
	  <li> dancing </li>
	  <li> gardening </li>
	  <li> biking </li>
	  <li> <a href="https://www.paws.org/volunteer/"> Paws Volunteer </a> </li>
	</ul>
